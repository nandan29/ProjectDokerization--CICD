ONCE YOU HAVE CREATED A REPO IN GITHUB  AND CLONED IT , FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS:-

STEPS:-
1) create conda environment

step i)
#conda --version  //to check weather conda environment is present or not

step ii)
#conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y

"""
-p is a prefix which indicates that folder with the name venv will be created in the project directory , and tis virtual env will be deleted as soon as we delete the project . If we give -m this directory will be created where anaconda is present.
"""

step iii)
#conda activate venv/



2) create requirements.txt file

requirements.txt contains list of all libraries or packages that we will need in the project.
"""
pip install -r requirements.txt
"""





3) create Dockerfile
i) which python version we want in our virtual  m/c .
 - FROM python:3.7

ii) In our virtual m/c there will be a folder called app , so we want to copy files from current directory in that directory
 - COPY . /app

**** some files and folders like .gitignore , venv , hidden file like .git we dont want in app folder so we will create a .dockerignore file and list down all the files which we dont want in our docker image

iii) now we will make app as our current working directory
 - WORKDIR /app

iv) now install all the required libraries in new virtual m/c
 - RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

v) we will set the port on which our application will run (since the port no is dynamic we will just supply the 
variable name and the port no will be provided by heroku during deployment)
 - EXPOSE $PORT

vi)Finally ,which file is needed to run the application i.e. app.py
 - CMD gunicorn --workers=4 --bind <ip-address>.$PORT app:app 

"""
example:-CMD gunicorn --workers=4 --bind 0.0.0.0.$PORT app:app 

**here 0.0.0.0 is local IP
**gunicorn  is used to handle web server request , when ever user is trying to access any url so it is the 
duty of gunicorn  to accept that request , bind it with the main logic and return response back to the user ,
it is based on linux m/c ans that is why we have given ubuntu m/c in main.yaml

***workers are basically the listeners for web server request. 


** gunicorn is specifically used to deploy web application
"""



4)Deploying Dockerised project in heroku

i) create .github folder and inside that workflows folder and inside tat create a file called main.yaml file.

3) TO connect CICD pipeline with heroku wen need 5 things :-
i) heroku login email = shubham.datascience29@gmail.com
ii) heroku api key = <dont keep it public>
iii) heroku app = cicd-app123
iv)location of Dockerfile
v)name of Dockerfile

In HEROKU for
****heeroku api key - [ topRightCorner under profile ->  accountSetting -> apikey -> reveal]
****heroku app = [click on new -> create new app -> give some name]


Github will allocate a virtual ubuntu m/c( as mentioned in main.yaml file) where docker image will be build using github action and for deploying that docker image on heroku we need 5 things which I already mentioned above.


iF U WILL GO TO ACTION TAB U WILL SEE BUILD FAILED FOR THAT WE HAVE TO PREPARE SECRETS

Now we will prepare the secrets

Go to ur created repo -> settings -> secrets -> actions -> new repository name 

NAME                    VALUE
HEROKU_EMAIL            shubham.datascience29@gmail.com         CLICK ON ADD SECRET
HEROKU_API_KEY          <dont keep it public>                   CLICK ON ADD SECRET
HEROKU_APP_NAME         cicd-app123                             CLICK ON ADD SECRET



ONCE ALL THE SECRETS ARE ADDED 
Go to ACTION TAB -> workflow ->  RERUN JOB AND THEN SELECT EITHER BUILD ALL JOBS/BUILD FAILED JOBS(TOP RIGHT CORNER) .YOU WILL SEE BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

Congrats , application is deployed successfully to HEROKU

open heroku -> click on your app -> click on open app

https://cicd-app123.herokuapp.com/  -- heroku link to fetch the result.

****now once u again push the result again the workflow will be created and again the buld will happen
